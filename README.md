## Abstract

## 
SP: Feature Extraction for Speech Recognition

The main tasks of this project are:

Task 1: Familiarize yourself with the project specifics (1-2 Weeks)
Read up on feature extraction methods mentioned in the reference materials. Learn about DNN training and PyTorch, how to visualize results with TensorBoard. Read up on DNN models aimed at time series (e.g. TCNs, RNNs, transformer networks) and the recent advances in KWS.

Task 2: Implement and evaluate the baseline (2-3 Weeks)
Select a dataset and analyse the models which can represent baselines for our work. Particularly check for publicly available code. The supervisors will provide you with the MFCC implementation that will represent the starting point for the aforementioned analysis.
If no code is available: design, implement, and train KWS models, considering the state-of-the-art architectures for time series.
Compare the model against the selected baseline and figures in the paper.

Task 3: Implement feature extraction techniques (4-5 Weeks)
Using the referenced work, implement the feature extraction methods against which MFCC will be compared.
Optimize said methods with respect to computational eï¬€ort and storage requirements.
(Optional) Perform parameter tuning for the implemented techniques.

Task 4: Evaluate feature extraction techniques (4-5 Weeks)
Evaluate and analyse the accuracy of the KWS pipeline with respect to the implemented feature extraction setting.
Evaluate and analyse the accuracy of the aforementioned methods under similar operating regimes.
Evaluate and analyse the compatibility between the processing techniques and the DNN architecture.

Task 5 - Gather and Present Final Results (2-3 Weeks)
Gather final results.
Prepare presentation (10 min. + 5 min. discussion).
Write a final report. Include all major decisions taken during the design process and argue your choice. Include everything that deviates from the very standard case - show off everything that took time to figure out and all your ideas that have influenced the project.
