# Semester project: Feature Extraction for Speech Recognition
## Abstract

The goals of this project are to:
- Modify the [kws-on-pulp](https://github.com/pulp-platform/kws-on-pulp) framework to enable running and comparison of existing state-of-the-art kws feature extraction methods and model architectures, 
- Analyse and compare the performance of existing KWS models, more specifically their feature extraction methods.
- Explore new feature extraction methods for KWS to obtain a high-accuracy, low latency and power consumption model.
